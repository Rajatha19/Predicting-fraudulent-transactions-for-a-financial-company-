💳 Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. With millions of transactions processed every day, fraud detection is essential for ensuring financial security and reducing monetary loss. The dataset used is large-scale (~6.3 million entries), allowing for robust model training and evaluation.
Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand class imbalance, transaction types, and correlation.

Data Preprocessing: Includes feature encoding, scaling, and handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.

Model Building: Trained multiple classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost).

Evaluation: Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.
